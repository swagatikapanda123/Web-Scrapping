We share a dream of having many more children. <br>Stacy has opened my eyes to the fact that marijuana doesn't really hurt anyone. We'll be growing it for ourselves, and trading it with the other people in the commune, for all the cocaine and ecstasy we want. <br>In the meantime, we'll pray that science will find a cure for AIDS, so Stacy can get better. She sure deserves it! <br>Don't worry, Dad. I'm 15, and I know how to take care of myself. Someday, I'm sure we'll be back to visit, so you can get to know your many grandchildren. <br>Love, your son, Joshua.<br>P.S. Dad, none of the above is true. I'm over at Jason's house.
